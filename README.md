I've always thought that it'd be cool if early in the morning, instead of opening 50-bajillion apps to see what I missed during my sleep, instead I could just have one interface/dashboard that tells me about it. 

I also thought that this project would be a very good demonstration of the usefulness of state-management libraries, and the skills I've gained through trying to work with them when I was making Roblox games. They are so good at keeping code modular, and is something hard for me to live without nowadays. (Thank you, Roblox TypeScript & Charm)
