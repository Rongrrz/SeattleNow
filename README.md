This project initially began as "DubPolls" but then I discovered that Reddit already does polling. And just to clarify, this is not supposed to be dystopian.

## On the Works:
- 🤖 Basic functionalities
- 📢 Integrating with Reddit for conversations
- 🙉 AI Summary
- 🔢 Integration with database to cache a few days back, for even more "Overseering"
